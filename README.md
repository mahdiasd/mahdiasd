### 🔧 About Me

I'm an accomplished Android Developer with 6 years of hands-on experience.  
I started with Java and gradually evolved to Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Flutter to craft modern, scalable, and user-focused mobile applications.

During my military service, I contributed to smart-glass projects and built secure applications for industrial environments in a knowledge-based company.

I'm passionate about learning, adapting to cutting-edge technologies, and solving real-world problems through clean, modular architecture.
